# Cross scramble examples

The scrambles are extracted from https://github.com/ChristianVaughn/C2F2L

https://christianvaughn.net/C2F2L is a tremendous tool that allows you
to set the difficulty of cross, and generate a scramble for you to practice
cross-to-F2L transition.

However I'm used to use csTimer to record time, so I have to scramble the cube
and then switch to csTimer every solve.  Too lazy to do that.  Therefore I
extract scrambles in each difficulty level into a plain text file, then I can
copy/paste it to csTimer using the "external input".
